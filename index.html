  <p>When I sat down to write about you, I wondered what words could possibly capture something so extraordinary it feels unreal — something that could touch your heart in a way I haven’t before. But moments later I realized: nothing I write will ever compare to the way I feel for you every single day. I celebrate you daily, my love. Every day feels like an anniversary; every second feels like a special moment meant just for us.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

    <img alt="" src="images/image13.jpg" style="max-height: 320px;">
  </div>
  <p>Yet my love for you still pulls my hands back to the page. My heart refuses to believe that you can be contained in words. It whispers to me, <span class="lovely">“Even if you spent a thousand nights standing in the cold waiting for enlightenment just to write about her — you’d still fail. She is undescribable. She is everything.”</span></p>

  <p>When I think about you, Anushka… I think in <span class="highlight">feelings</span>.<br> You are an instinct.<br> In my mind, you exist as a sensation — a beautiful one.<br> When your hands touch my skin, it’s your soul that reaches me. Your physical self is just the surface of a far more beautiful essence. The bittersweet memories ripen. Your presence is engraved on me.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And now… I can’t wait any longer. I have to talk about the <span class="highlight">first day</span>.</p>
  <p class="lovely centered" style="text-align: center;">26 November 2024</p>
  <p>I won’t talk about who I was before you, because my life began the moment I laid eyes on you. I still remember — a clueless guy whose parents were returning from Kashmir the next day after celebrating their anniversary, unaware that <span class="lovely">his own</span> life would change on the night of November 26th.</p>
  <div class="image-group">
    <img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="max-height: 360px;">

  </div>
  <p>I saw you there — dressed in a black jacket, cheeks touched with blush, eyes so big and bright that if someone stared long enough, they’d see the Milky Way hidden inside them. Lips that make a lotus jealous. Skin crafted by the god of winter.</p>
  <p>I arrived near the mandir to find you waiting… and I had no idea I was about to carry my future wife. I looked like an Uber driver; you looked unreasonably gorgeous. Your phone was in your hand as if you were about to tell me an OTP — which, I swear, was not entirely your fault.</p>
  <p>That was the moment.<br>
    <span class="highlight">The</span> moment.
  </p>
  <p>With you, life became as strange as a novel yet as simple as an everyday love. With you, I lived everywhere at once. I lived a thousand lifetimes.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>And now here we are — “long-distance,” as the world calls it. But to me, it means:</p>
  
  <div class="special-list-section">
    <p class="highlight" style="text-align: center;">What "LONG DISTANCE" Means To Me</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">L</span> – Love</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">O</span> – One-hearted</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">N</span> – Never-ending</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">G</span> – Growing</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">D</span> – Devotion</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">I</span> – Intimacy (of hearts)</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">S</span> – Strength</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">T</span> – Tenderness & Trust</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">A</span> – Always</li>

  </div>
  
  <p class="lovely centered" style="text-align: center;">Aankhe jo puchti hain sawaal, mere dil deta hai unke jawaab.</p>
  <p>This long-distance?<br> I consider it <span class="highlight">everything</span>, if I go by my definition.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>When we met, we were new to each other. And now, we are nothing <span class="lovely">but</span> new — always learning, always evolving. Sometimes I feel like a grown man who can’t recognize the person he was a year ago. I wonder, <span class="lovely">“What was I even thinking? Who was that?”</span></p>
  <div class="image-group">
    <img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="max-height: 360px;">

  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>We made each other — carving our best selves for one another, shaping our days and our ways with love as our chisel. If there’s one thing this year has taught me, one thing I truly believe now, it’s this: <span class="highlight">take things as they come.</span> No amount of planning ever works the way we imagine. And yet, somehow, everything still falls into place when love is involved.</p>
  <p>All the anxieties of the heart — the fear, the overthinking, the uncertainty — they fade the moment the feeling of <span class="lovely">us</span> becomes stronger. When togetherness rises above distance, above time, above everything that tries to shake us.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>Distance feels harsh, I won’t deny that. It stings. It stretches. It tests.<br> But it’s bearable — because our hearts always find a way back to each other.<br> Always.</p>
  <p>Love!! Isn’t it amazing, Anushka? Isn’t it??<br> How can something be so strange and yet so comforting at the same time.<br> How can it ease every ache and guide us to places no one else could lead us.</p>
